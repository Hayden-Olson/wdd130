      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 07 - Fill in your purpose. In 2–3 sentences, write the purpose statement from your elevator pitch -->
      <p>I wish to create a website to showcase the game I want to make called "Mech Quest". The website will inform the audience of what the game is, the content they can expect to see, and have a page for community contact and updates. It is somewhat like a Kickstarter page, only I am not taking donations or funds of any kind, rather just informing those interested in the idea of the game.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 07 - write about your intended audience. Who are they? How old are they? Why will they be using your site? What do you want them to do? -->
      <p>Older audience members who are searching for an open world adventure game to play. There may be mature themes, so 18+ may be the target audience. This sites purpose will be to create a community and spark interest for the game I wish to make. It could potentially become a kickstarter page once the game making process truly begins. Having an existing community can help projects like this lift off quickly.</p>

      <h3>Gameplay Page</h3>
      <p>[This game will have Dungeons and Dragons style combat, where positioning matters, attacks have range, and environmental features can interfere in a manner of ways. Instead of rolling dice for damage, most attacks and actions will be tied to “action commands”, properly following the button prompts and inputs that pops up. You can also guard incoming attacks, or dodge/counter attacks (depending on the character) if timed correctly. The player will have 2 – 3 people on the field at a time but will have more party members for back up. Combine different characters together and see how well they match up together! Every character will have a passive ability that activates on its own, and their own class. For instance, Rocket, the main character, is a wide range bruiser. He typically does physical punches that can reach from across the map. His passive ability is a cheer for his teammates, which stops a negative mechanic from activating as long as he is on the field.  

        The negative mechanic in question is the hope meter, which naturally depletes over time. The idea would be that you need to focus on keeping up the spirits of your allies while in combat as you defend and attack. This meter would tie in the combat with the story focus of managing emotions and taking care of your mental health. Each character would have varrying methods of cheering others up, that can have additional benefits or downsides. This mechanic would shake up combat strategy, now needing to focus on maintaining a balance of fighting, placement, and rallying the team. When the meter is depleted, combat becomes a nightmare. Team attacks cannot be performed, enemies deal more damage than normal, and some team members may not even attack. 
        
        There is an overworld to explore that has platforming and exploration outside of combat. Each area has a wide array of characters you can talk to who have their own storys an dilemnas going on. 
        
        There would be minigames that occur at certain story moments that change up the gameplay. A runner minigame, where you charge down a set of lanes and dodge incoming obsticals, a shoot-em-up minigame, where you fly in a plane and shoot incoming enemies as you dodge their bullets, a racing minigame, where you drive around a course racing another, and a bullet hell minigame, where you only dodge specially designed bullets patterns. 
        
        Some mechanics in this game take heavy inspiration from other titles. There are plans to create a recipe list similar to the ones from Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door or Bug Fables The Everlasting Sapling, where the player can create new items through experimentation. From the same games, this title will also have an enemy discription log, low number stats (like how typical damage would be 2 instead of 20 like in other Role Playing Games like Final Fantasy), and customizable team builds (Giving the player different weapons, badges, and upgrades to choose from for each character). The emotion mechanic is based on the one from OMORI, where the characters stats are altered depending on their emotional state. The bullet hell sections are an idea from games like Deltarune and Just Shapes and Beats, where the player has to dodge a longer and more complex attack from foes. ]</p>

      <h3>Story Page</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        [The story mainly follows Rocket, a young boy who wants to become a hero of the land. He comes to realize that there is more to saving others besides taking down the villain of the day. The story will cover aspects of mental health and contains elements of depression and suicide. Emotional wellbeing is an immense part of the focus for the game, even centering the magic system on emotions and having emotional care in combat. 

        Even though the game would cover some heavy topics, I want the general tone of the game to be lighthearted and fun. I want to have the dialogue be humorous and witty. This would be contrasted by characters like Sho-King, the mysterious captain of the military “SKIES”, who is dangerously serious about achieving their goal in collecting the magic gems. 
        
        The hero team will travel through an odd variety of areas like a colorful toy canyon full of sentient cannon creatures, a candy forest with a troubled history, and an overgrown casino town where shady tactics are promoted. They get caught up in many wacky scenerios like battling pirates who wield fish, robbing a train, and a high speed car chase escaping from a zombie drug cartel boss. 
        
        This is a personal game I have been working on since I was around 8 years old. Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door has always been my favorite game, and I have wanted to see a sequel to it. Unfortunately, the series would take a different direction than I wanted, so I have been trying to make my own sort of sequel successor game to it. It transformed from a fanmade Mario game, which I had called “Mario and Luigi’s Epic Quest”, into a more original title. I combined ideas I had from other different titles like Megaman, where I had my own fanmade robot masters, into the game to add some more ideas into the mix. I had to stray away from the stage elements of Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door in favor of more flexable combat strategy. Eventually, it came to be called Mech Quest. The title’s purpose is to highlight the nature of magic and adventure mixed in with futuristic elements like robots. This game from the start has always been a passion project that combined ideas from other titles.   
        
        The main antagonist, Marvallo the worlds most powerful wizard, has been part of the game since inception. He has gone from a generic villain to a troubled isolationist who struggles with immense self hatred. His personal issues end up affecting the world around him passively since magic is tied into emotions. A question is left up in the air about whether he even has intentions to destroy the world, or if everything is just a big misunderstanding. He is veiled in mystery and blocked off from the rest of the world. His actions are confusing even to his closest allies, who believe he plans to destroy the world in a spectacular manner. It is up to Rocket and his friends to penetrate the barrier he has amassed around himself and uncover the truth. ]
